```hcl
#1. Define empty resource in your <somefile>.tf

    resource "athenz_policy_version" "import_policy_versions" {
    }

#2. In the directory where the file is located, run this command:

   Ö¿$ terraform import athenz_policy_version.import_policy_versions <domain>:policy.<policy name>

#3. Make any adjustments to the configuration to align with the current (or desired) state of the imported object.
